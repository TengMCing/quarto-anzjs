abstract: |
  This document serves to illustrate some of the main features of
  the \LaTeX\ document class ``\texttt{anzsauth}'' which authors are
  strongly encouraged to use when preparing papers for submission
  to the \textit{Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics}.
  The importance of clarity of exposition as well as a number of
  issues that frequently arise in respect of the Journal's standards
  and conventions are emphasised.  The Journal has precise requirements
  for the format of bibliographic references and citations.  It is much
  easier for authors to conform to these requirements if they use the
  resources provided by \BibTeX\ and the \texttt{anzsj} bibliography
  style.  Authors are very strongly encouraged to avail themselves
  of these resources.  The use of \BibTeX\ syntax is illustrated.
  This document emphasises a few of the notational conventions that
  form an important part of the Journal's stylistic requirements.
  A great deal more material about these requirements may be found
  in the document ``\textit{ANZJS Style Guide for Authors}'' in the
  file \texttt{styleGuide.pdf}.  That file is included in the zip
  archive of material from which you obtained the document that you
  are currently reading, i.e. \texttt{protoType.pdf}.
